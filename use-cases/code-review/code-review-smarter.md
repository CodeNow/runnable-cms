When developers mention the daily tasks that take the most time out of their day, somewhere at the top of the list is usually code review. Whether it’s reviewing new commits, merges, or new application code, the hours usually spent reviewing code are made even longer if one has an inefficient code review pipeline or process. The benefits of peer reviewing one’s code, even if it has passed automated testing, can help reduce not only typical pain points such as addressing memory leaks, but in some cases show developers new ways of looking at code they’ve seen countless times. 

With tools such as Runnable as part of a solid CI/CD pipeline and pair programming, developers can team up to tackle even the most challenging project without struggling to figure out where they left off on a daily basis or having to re-do a fix every time new code is merged into production. 

## Every Service Version, Every Time

Part of what sets Runnable apart is the fact that it gives developers the ability to easily run every version of their service and application. Coupled with up-to-date environment URLs, this means that developers working together as part of a team can import their existing Dockerfiles or application code and get to work without having to burden their DevOps team to set up a secure staging or testing server. 

Since Runnable is launched directly from the user’s browser, this means that the typical, “well, it worked on my machine,” excuse is history. Ensuring that everyone’s environment, branches, libraries, and versions of tools are up to date can take up valuable time that could better be spent actually combing through code. With Runnable, applications are given their own test environment and tools when each new branch is created.

Applications now include their own end-to-end stack complete with all the tools and databases needed to hit the ground running. Whether it’s getting the latest version of MongoDB or setting up an application running Python or Node, Runnable ensures that every change made is visible to your team when and where it matters most.

## Harnessing Team Knowledge

One of the strongest benefits to a peer review process is the ability to keep track of changes and get feedback on new updates. In a traditional setup, new merges and patches can get pushed to production after passing an automated test that vets them as, “Good enough to pass, good enough for production,” and potentially only get reviewed by the developer that wrote the fix. Enforcing a peer review adds shared accountability on every change, and enables your entire team to stay intimiate with their evolving codebase.

With Runnable, setting up a demo to show exactly how something is done before it goes live can help junior developers visualize problems in their code in new ways. For senior developers, starting a demo means that they can better address things from every possible angle, analyzing new code to ensure that it meets company standards. The benefits to demonstrating new changes and code even exist for DevOps, Security, Product and Marketing teams. Their early feedback can help ensure that your changes are secure, able to scale under load, and will perform to the user's expectations.

## Takeaways

Overall, getting started with code review can be a daunting task. However, it’s not one that should be ignored. That’s where Runnable comes in. By integrating one’s application workflow into a more agile, streamlined process, software developers worldwide can ensure their code works as intended every time.
