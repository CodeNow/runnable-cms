excerpt: Use Runnable to speed up code review.
description: Code reviews are essential, but they're one of the least favorable tasks for developers. Reading and understanding hundreds of lines of someone else's code is difficult. Learn how Runnable simplifies this process by enabling you to try out the changes beforehand.

Reviewing code is one of the most time-intensive tasks developers are facing today. Even when pair programming, errors can take hours or even days to catch, costing time and money for an organization. Integrating automated testing and continuous deployment cycles can help detect failing code before it enters production, particularly when paired with tools such as Runnable. With the ability to integrate directly into one’s GitHub account, it offers developers much needed flexibility to add their application directly into their pull request page.

## Getting Started with Code Review

When breaking down code reviews, implementing agile development practices and adhering to standardization is key. Code review in and of itself is a platform-agnostic process, as any developer working on software should be reviewing their code regardless of the language it is written in. That being said, developers working on front-end applications will have different needs than those focusing on back-end solutions. Determining your team’s primary use cases and your overall goals for your workflow pipeline will help make your time reviewing code easier.

Runnable offers developers across a variety of platforms the tools to integrate their GitHub repository so that an entire team can view and work together to review an application’s code. After signing up for Runnable, developers are able to choose from a number of stack architectures such as Node.js, Ruby, Rails, PHP, and Python. Rather than having to struggle through the traditional setup of building a container, Runnable does so with a single click. When working on an application with Runnable, developers will automatically have an environment created that is kept up-to-date as soon as they create a new branch, allowing for a faster transition between the time code is pushed and the time it’s reviewed.

This is particularly useful for companies looking to implement agile development practices such as a continuous delivery pipeline, or that are committed to pushing out fixes and patches regularly. Even for projects that update rarely, when new commits are made to a project, they are added automatically to Runnable and the project’s container is rebuilt. Whether running applications from within one’s organization or a database, Runnable provides the ability to clearly review, analyze, and comment on code as it comes in.

## Community Knowledge Transfer

One of the most beneficial parts of code review is the ability to hear from team members that may not always have the floor in a day-to-day situation. This means that things that may slip by a team that’s running on autopilot can often be caught by those that are reviewing code with fresh eyes. Another crucial benefit to reviewing code with Runnable is the fact that its ease of use enables better collaboration and teamwork.

All too often, developers are met with the challenge of remote team members unable to participate in a task due to the inability to get a piece of the required stack running on their machine. Because Runnable is deployed directly from the user’s browser, there is nothing to install locally. This means that regardless of one’s hardware configuration or platform, they can contribute equally to the code review process.

## Work Smarter, Not Harder

Creating and empowering developers to share ideas about how code is written, debugged, and streamlined allows for not only better software, but better technology for the future. It is only when we foster a community based on the equal exchange of ideas and information regardless of technical background or bias that the software industry is able to move forward and advance. Having a team-based code review process means that an organization’s entire team is invested in the end product, allowing for all working on an application to be able to contribute not only in production or when something breaks, but on a daily basis. This sharing of the workload means that there’s less chance for team member burnout, and fosters an overall more comfortable working environment.

Rather than having team members rush to complete their code so that it can simply be merged, implementing a solid code review process before pushing commits upstream ensures that developers can slow down and take their time to ensure code is review-ready prior to merging. This also lessens the likelihood of a piece of code getting put into production with vulnerabilities or otherwise buggy features such as memory leaks or buffer overflows.

## Takeaways

Overall, getting started with code review can be a daunting task. However, it’s not one that should be ignored. That’s where Runnable comes in. By integrating one’s application workflow into a more agile, streamlined process, software developers worldwide can ensure their code works as intended every time.
